ChemoCaffe is a python wrapper for Caffe.  It's purpose is to automate the training and testing of DNN's while only having to modify one configuration file.


ChemoCaffe is built upon the following software:
================================================================================
List of software required:
1) Caffe rc3 : https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/releases/tag/rc3
2) Python 2.7.9
3) Python hdf5 : http://www.h5py.org/
4) CUDA 7.5: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
5) Boost Version 1.59.0 : http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_59_0.html
6) Scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
7) Rdkit: http://www.rdkit.org/
================================================================================
---Preparing the data---
First, we need to generate our descriptors using Rdkit.

1) Use RdkitDescriptors.py to generate circular fingerprints in binary format
2) Input format: 'CID,SMILES,Label'

Once you follow the instructions above, it is time to prepare the data to be read by Caffe.

1) "PrepareDataToHDF5.py" Script can be used to split a dataset into train/test and validation, e.g. 60% for tuning and 40% for validation.
2) The "PrepareDataToHDF5.py" generates the train file, which then is split into 5-fold cross validation (train-test files) and a validation set.
3) All files generated by "PrepareDataToHDF5.py" are stored into csv and hdf5 file formats. ChemoCaffe requires both types of files.
---Tuning the network---
1) Open example.cfg
2) Prepare the configuration file.
	-[DEFAULT] section contains global parameters that apply to all of your networks.
	-[Net1], [Net2], ..., [NetN] are used to define different network configurations to be tested.  Just add another section if you would like to test more than 2 networks.
3) After you have set up your configuration files and prepared your data, type "python ChemoCaffe_tune.py path/to/example.cfg" to run the program
4) After some time, your results should be located in the CSV file specified in the configuration file.

---Generating Predictions---
1) Open Scripts/Predict/predict.cfg
2) Select a few networks that gave you good results while tuning the network and add them to the configuration file.
	-[DEFAULT] section contains global parameters that apply to all of your networks.
	-[Net1], [Net2], ..., [NetN] are used to define different network configurations to be tested.  Just add another section if you would like to test more than 2 networks.
3) After you have set up your configuration files and prepared your data, type "python ChemoCaffe_predict.py path/to/predict.cfg" to run the program
4) The predictions should be available in the file specified in the output field in the configuration file.
